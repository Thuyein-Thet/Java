Encapsulation
-------------
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
For example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
We can use getter and setter methods to set and get the data in it.
Example : 'Java Bean' class

Advantage
---------
By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
It provides you the control over the data.
It is a way to achieve data hiding.
The encapsulate class is easy to test, bettter for unit testing.
Easy and fast to create an encapsulated class.
