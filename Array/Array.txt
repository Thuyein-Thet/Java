Advantages
----------
Code Optimization : It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
Random Access : We can get any data located at an index position.

Disadvantages
-------------
Size Limit : We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

Types of Array in Java
----------------------
Two Types of array:
(1) Single Dimensional Array
(2) Multidimensional Array

(1) Single Dimensional Array
----------------------------

Syntax :

            dataType[] arr;
                (OR)
            dataType []arr;
                (OR)
            dataType arr[];

Instantiation :

            arrayRefVar = new dataType[size];
