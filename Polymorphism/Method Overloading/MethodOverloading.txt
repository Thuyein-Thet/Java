Method Overloading
------------------
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

Advantage
---------
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.

Different ways to overload the method
-------------------------------------
(1) By changing number of arguments
(2) By changing the data type

***In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.***

*************************
overloading main() method
*************************
 You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only.
