Convariant Return type
----------------------
The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass.

Advantages
----------
(1) Covariant return type assists to stay away from the confusing type casts in the class hierarchy and makes the code more usable, readable, and maintainable.
(2) In the method overriding, the covariant return type provides the liberty to have more to the point return types.
(3) Covariant return type helps in preventing the run-time ClassCastExceptions on returns.
