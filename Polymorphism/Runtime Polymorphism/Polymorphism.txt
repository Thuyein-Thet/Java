Polymorphism
------------
Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.
two types: (1) Compiletime polymorphism
           (2) Runtime polymorphism

Runtime Polymorphism
--------------------
a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

***Runtime Polymorphism can't be achieved by data member***
