Method Overridding
------------------
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

Usage
-----
used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
used for runtime polymorphism

*****
Rules
*****
(1) The method must have the same name as in the parent class
(2) The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
(3) There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).
*****

***A Static method cannot be override.***
------------------------------------------
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area.
