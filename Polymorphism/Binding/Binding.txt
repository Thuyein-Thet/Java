(1) Static-Binding (aka) early Binding
(2) Dynamic-Binding (aka) late Binding

Static Binding
--------------
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.

Dynamic Binding
---------------
When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.
