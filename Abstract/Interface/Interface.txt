Interface
---------
An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
There can be only abstract methods in the java interface, not method body.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can sat that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables.
It cannot have a method body.
Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.

Why use Interface?
------------------
Three Reasons:
(1) To achieve abstraction
(2) By Interface, can support the functionality of multiple inheritance
(3) To achieve loose coupling

Syntax:

    interface <interface_name>{  
      
    // declare constant fields  
    // declare methods that abstract   
    // by default.  
    }  

***************************
class extends class
class implements interface
interface extends interface

Marker or Tagged Interface
--------------------------
An interface which has no member is known as a marker or tagged interface.
For example, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc.
They are used to provide some essential information to the JVM so JVM may perform some useful operation.

Nested Interface in Java
------------------------
An interface can have another interface which is known ass a nested interface.

    interface printable{
        void print();
        interface MessagePrintable{
            void msg();
        }
    }
