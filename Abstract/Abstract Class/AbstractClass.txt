Abstract Class
--------------
A class which is declared with the abstract keywoard is known as an abstract class in Java. 
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods(Method with body).

Abstraction
-----------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
It shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details.

Two ways
--------
(1) Abstract class (0% to 100%)
(2) Interface (100%)

(1) Abstract Class
------------------
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It needs to be extended and its method method implemented.
It cannot be instantiated.
Abstract class can have a data member, abstract method, method body(non-abstract method), constructor amd even main() method.

******************
Points to remember
******************
- An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keywoard
- It can have abstract and non-abstract methods
- It cannot be instantiated
- It can have constructors and static methods also
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method
******************

Abstract Method
---------------
A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

***If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.***
