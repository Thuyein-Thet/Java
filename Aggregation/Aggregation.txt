Aggregation
-----------
If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.

***************************************
class Employee{  
int id;  
String name;  
Address address;//Address is a class  
...  
}  
***************************************
IEmployee has an entity reference address, so relationship is Employee HAS-A address.

Why use Aggregation?
--------------------
Code reuse is also best achieved by aggregation when there is no is-a relationship.
Inheritance should be used only if the relationship is-a is maintained throughout the lifetime of the objects involved; otherwise, aggregation is the best choice.
